## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Before running the notebooks, install the required Python libraries. You can use the `requirements.txt` file or the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib tqdm
Run the Notebooks:
Open any notebook in your preferred Jupyter environment and run the cells sequentially. Each notebook is self-contained and demonstrates the diffusion process for the specified dataset.

Generate Results:
Most notebooks include visualization of the diffusion process (e.g., denoising steps). Adjust hyperparameters as needed for better understanding or experimentation.

About Diffusion Models
Diffusion models iteratively add noise to data and then train a neural network to reverse this process, effectively learning the data distribution. This project aims to explore their behavior on a variety of datasets, ranging from simple distributions to real-world datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10.

Future Work
Potential expansions of this project:

Applying diffusion models to 3D point clouds (e.g., object reconstruction).
Experimenting with real-world datasets such as satellite imagery or biological signals.
Comparing different neural network architectures for reverse diffusion.
